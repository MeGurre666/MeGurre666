### Wasup :stuck_out_tongue:

I am a very cool Swedish High School student. I am currently studying Technic (sounds better in swedish).

My current tasks are attempting to learn HTML and CSS :grimacing:

Which I know sounds super fun, but don't judge me if I accidently say HTML is a programming language. Force of habit
