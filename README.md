### Wasup :stuck_out_tongue:

I am a very cool Swedish High School student. I am currently studying technology (A cool program in Swedish High Schools).

My current tasks are attempting to learn HTML and CSS :grimacing:

Which I know sounds super fun, but don't judge me if I accidently say HTML is a programming language. Force of habit 

Wait, nearly forgot to mention that I am not a worshipper of Satan as you might think with those 3 numbers at the end of my name. I do indeed like the Church of Satan on twitter. I don't worship satan.

Pls no karens
